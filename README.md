Sentiment Analysis Web App and EDA  😃
=============================

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis EDA and  Web App built with Streamlit! This app performs sentiment analysis on input text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and SpaCy's pre-trained models. 🚀

Project Overview 📊
-------------------

This project is designed to uncover sentiment insights on the twitter dataset and analyze the sentiment of text input by users. It uses machine learning models (Random Forest) to classify the text as either positive, negative, or neutral. The backend uses **SpaCy** and **scikit-learn** for processing and model prediction.

Technologies Used 🛠️
---------------------

*   **Streamlit** - For creating the interactive web application
*   **SpaCy** - For natural language processing and sentiment analysis
*   **scikit-learn** - For machine learning algorithms
*   **WordCloud** - For generating word clouds based on sentiment data
*   **seaborn & matplotlib** - For data visualization
*   **Jupyter Notebook** - For Exploratory data analysis
*   **TF-IDF** -For Vectorization of tokens.
